## BMI-BMR_Health_Calculator_Android_Mobile_Application_With_JAVA-XML

This Android health calculator app calculates both Body Mass Index (BMI) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) based on user-provided information such as weight, height, age, and gender. The app has a user interface with input fields for weight, height in feet and inches, age, and gender selection through checkboxes for male or female. Upon clicking the "Calculate" button, the app computes the BMI using the standard formula and provides a corresponding classification (Underweight, Healthy Weight, Overweight, or Obese). Additionally, based on the selected gender, the app calculates the BMR using specific formulas for males and females and displays the result along with the BMI classification. Users can navigate back to the input screen using the "Back" button. The app aims to provide users with insights into their body composition and metabolic rate to promote awareness of their health status.
